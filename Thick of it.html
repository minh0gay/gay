        A Disjointed Opening
      </h2>
      <p>
        KSI's "Thick Of It" featuring Trippie Redd is a bit of a mixed bag. While the track has some redeeming qualities, it ultimately falls short of expectations. The song opens with a clean guitar riff that quickly gives way to KSI's vocals, which, unfortunately, sound sloppy and over-processed. The layered vocals feel disjointed and lack cohesion, creating a messy soundscape.

      </h2>
      <p>
        As the song progresses, it transitions into a pop-infused track with glimpses of Trippie Redd's vocals. However, KSI's energy feels lacking, and the verses are too short, giving the impression that the chorus arrives prematurely. Trippie Redd's feature injects much-needed energy and passion into the song, but his contribution is fleeting, leaving the listener wanting more. A longer feature from Trippie Redd could have significantly elevated the track.

      <p>
        Lyrically, "Thick Of It" touches upon KSI's journey from YouTube to music and boxing, highlighting his success and resilience. However, the lyrics lack depth and originality, relying on familiar tropes about overcoming adversity and achieving greatness. The chorus, while catchy, is repetitive and becomes tiresome after a few listens.

        An Unfulfilled Promise
      </h2>
      <p>
        "Thick Of It" is a decent attempt by KSI to create a catchy pop song with a hip-hop edge. However, the track suffers from several shortcomings, including KSI's underwhelming vocal performance, the brevity of Trippie Redd's feature, and the lackluster lyrics. While the song may appeal to die-hard KSI fans, it's unlikely to make a lasting impact on the wider music scene.

      <p>
        "Thick Of It" is a passable but ultimately forgettable track that fails to showcase KSI's full potential as a musician. While the song has its moments, it's not a particularly strong addition to KSI's discography.

The song delves into his ability to navigate fame and controversy, highlighting his "thick skin" and unwavering determination to rise above challenges and achieve his goals.

        A Chorus of Confidence and Resilience
      </h2>
      <p>
        KSI's "Thick Of It" is an anthem of self-belief and resilience, with lyrics that serve to assert his dominance, acknowledge his critics, and celebrate his journey to success. The chorus immediately sets this tone with the line "I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows," likely referring to navigating his career amidst fame, controversies, and public scrutiny. This "thick skin" is further emphasized by lines like "They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze," suggesting KSI confidently enters new spaces, leaving others intimidated by his impact. He reinforces this confidence with a playful wordplay: "I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold," implying he's inherently "cold" (successful and untouchable) and therefore unfamiliar with being "iced out" or rejected.

      <h2 id="In-depth into Thick Of It Verse 1">
        Verse 1: From Living Room to Limelight
      </h2>
      <p>
        His first verse delves into the specifics of his journey.  "I'm in my prime, and this ain't even final form," cleverly references both his peak performance and the drink Prime, while alluding to his continued growth and potential. He acknowledges setbacks with "They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor," highlighting his resilience. The line "I went from living rooms straight out to sold out tours" traces his trajectory from YouTuber to performer, although the claim of "sold out tours" might be an exaggeration as he struggled to sell tickets in shows that weren‚Äôt within the UK or Ireland.  Regardless, it reinforces the narrative of his rise to fame.

      <h2 id="In-depth into Thick Of It Verse 2">
        Verse 2:  A Multi-Faceted King
      </h2>
      <p>
        The second verse further emphasizes his multi-faceted career: "From the screen to the ring, to the pen, to the king."  This progression from YouTube ("screen") to boxing ("ring"), to music ("pen"), culminates in his self-proclaimed status as "king."  Lines like "Where's my crown? That's my bling" and "Always drama when I ring" playfully acknowledge his success and the controversies that inevitably surround him.  He closes his verse with a declaration of ambition and self-belief: "See, I believe that if I see it in my heart / Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reaching for the stars."

        A Final Word:  Confidence in the Face of Adversity
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ultimately, "Thick Of It" serves as a testament to KSI's unwavering confidence and ambition, even when faced with adversity.  The song's release amidst the DanTDM controversy adds a layer of defiance, making it a bold statement of self-belief in the face of criticism.      </p>
